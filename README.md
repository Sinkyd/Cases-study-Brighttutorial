Bright Coffee Shop Sales Analysis
Case Study Summary
This document summarizes the findings of a 6-month sales analysis conducted for Bright Coffee Shop (January 2023 - June 2023) across its three locations: Manhattan, Hell's Kitchen, and Astoria. The analysis was initiated due to a concerning sales decline from April to June 2023, leading to revenue loss, employee layoffs, and product discontinuation. A new CEO appointed a data-driven rescue mission, leveraging data analysis to understand performance and inform strategic decisions.
1. Project Overview & Methodology
The project aimed to understand daily performance per location and identify peak product performance times. The following steps were taken:
•	Architectural Planning: A mind map was created using Miro to outline the data flow and analysis process.
•	Data Extraction: Transactional data was extracted from the Point of Sale (POS) system across all three locations.
•	Data Warehousing: The extracted data was loaded into a Snowflake data warehouse for efficient processing and analysis.
•	Data Aggregation: SQL scripts were developed to aggregate the transactional data, calculating key metrics like daily sales, product performance, and hourly trends.
•	Data Visualization: Microsoft Excel was used for initial data exploration and visualization. PowerBI was also utilized for more dynamic and interactive dashboards.
•	Reporting & Presentation: Insights were compiled into a presentation using Canva and PowerPoint, with a concise summary of key findings.
